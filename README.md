## Overview

Mentat is an educational tool for both course mentors and students. It's primary purpose is to
generate test harnesses that can be used during automated grading processes for project
submissions. These test harnesses are driver programs only at this time; the user must provide test
cases and a sample executable for comparison purposes. The target output language is Bash script.
